## This script analyzes the relationship between host weight, thrashing frequency, and escape probability for *M. mediator* using logistic regression.

A logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between host weight, thrashing frequency, and the likelihood of a host exhibiting drop behavior in *M. mediator*.

```{r}
# --- Filter data for M. mediator (mm) and Drop vs No Drop ---
mediator_data_drop <- data %>% 
  filter(wasp.species == "mm") %>%
  select(host.weight, thrash.frequency, host.drop) %>%
  mutate(Drop = ifelse(host.drop == 1, "Drop", "No Drop"))

# --- Logistic Regression Model: Drop vs No Drop ---
# Logistic regression model for Drop vs No Drop
logit_model_drop <- glm(host.drop ~ host.weight + thrash.frequency, 
                        data = mediator_data_drop, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# Displaying the summary of the logistic regression model
summary(logit_model_drop)

# Predicted probabilities from the Drop vs No Drop model
mediator_data_drop$predicted_prob <- predict(logit_model_drop, type = "response")

# Plotting predicted probabilities vs actual Drop status
ggplot(mediator_data_drop, aes(x = predicted_prob, fill = Drop)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", binwidth = 0.05, alpha = 0.7) +
