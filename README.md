# "Data" project

This is the final project for the subject "Data Acquisition Analysis and Scientific Methods for Life Sciences" shorted as "Data" from the first course of the Master Plant Health at the Universitat Politècnica de València.

In this project the students chose a scientific article and redo all possible statistic analyses and graphics from it, trying different approaches to see if they can improve them. They will use the data included in the article and follow the Material and methods chapter as a guide.

## Chosen article

[Defensive behaviors of the Oriental armyworm Mythimna separata in response to different parasitoid species](https://peerj.com/articles/3690/)

This article provides experimental data on the behavioral defenses of M. separata larvae when exposed to Microplitis mediator and Meteorus pulchricornis.

## Proposal

You have a nice article to follow and enough data to work with. There are few variables to do multivariate analyses. You can try some just to check. But it is interesting that you learn how to compare different models: linear models and generalized linear models, with more or less variables and ways to decide which is the best model. 

### The Objectives

1.  To determine how the defensive behaviors of Mythimna separata larvae vary with their body size and the parasitoid species (Microplitis mediator and Meteorus pulchricornis).
2.  To examine the influence of larval defensive behaviors on parasitoid handling time and the likelihood of successful stinging.
3.  To investigate whether M. separata larvae exhibit distinct defensive responses to parasitoid species with different oviposition behaviors.
4.  To provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics of host-parasitoid behavioral interactions and explain differences in parasitism rates between the two parasitoid species.

### Hypotheses

1.  Do the defensive behaviors of Mythimna separata larvae differ in response to the two parasitoid species, Microplitis mediator and Meteorus pulchricornis, which have distinct oviposition strategies?
2.  How does the body size of M. separata larvae influence their defensive behaviors against these parasitoid species?
3.  Does the effectiveness of thrashing and other defensive behaviors in reducing parasitism success vary between the two parasitoid species?
4.  How does host body size affect the handling time and stinging likelihood of each parasitoid species?

### Analyzes needed or intended

1.  Logistic Regression Analysis.

2.  Linear Regression Analysis.

3.  Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

4.  Logistic Model for Ovipositor Stinging.

5.  Consideration of Overdispersion.

6.  Robust Standard Errors.
